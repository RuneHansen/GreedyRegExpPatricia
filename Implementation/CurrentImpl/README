Type make to compile the code.
Run code by ./TestSimpleI, follow onscreen instructions.

Code for testing lies in TestSimpleI.cpp.
The array implementation is in Simple_aNFASimulator.cpp/h.
The PATRICIA implementation and list implementation is in Patricia_aNFASimulator.cpp/h.
The preprocessing lies in aNFAgen.cpp and tranMatrix.cpp.

parser.cpp/h/y, lex.cpp/h and regex.cpp/h were handed out to us by our supervisors,
and contain code for handling the preprocessing.
